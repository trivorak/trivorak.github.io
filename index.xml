      <description>Another Blog? After being inspired by a linux enthusist, I wanted to put together a simple blog to desicribe some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on&amp;hellip; or whatever is on my mind at the time.
Building it for? I will try to post things that are a bit evergreen.
-Enjoy</description>
