<p>Rundown on how to use some of the scripts that I created in my github repositories&hellip; midigen/imgnoise/calcnoise/music16</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>While living with a close friend he told me about an idea a co-worker and himself had. What if the hash from every git commit would make a raspberry pi play a little tune.</p>
<p>Over the years I would come across some sort of technology and hack away at trying to make this silly idea possible.</p>
<p>That idea stuck with me for over 10+ years. It wasn&rsquo;t until years later while discovering Sonic Pi did this idea pop back into my mind as &ldquo;doable.&rdquo; While Sonic Pi was a very cool program, it just wasn&rsquo;t what I needed. I was only ever able to generate a 4 to the floor kick drum pattern before I abandoned Sonic Pi all together.</p>
<h3 id="ah-ha">Ah-Ha</h3>
<p>A couple key moments really unlocked how I thought about this projects. From a music point of view once I realized that midi is 128 values and so if I treat everything as 0-127 then conversion from binary/hex/int would be fairly smooth</p>
<h3 id="key-libraries">Key libraries</h3>
<p>The main library that really unlocked a lot for me is the python library <strong>MidiUtil</strong>. This allows me to write data into a simple midi file. Although my projects do stray away from thei intial idea, I feel like I can do alot with softsynths in a DAW. All of my scripts basically generate a simple midi file.</p>
